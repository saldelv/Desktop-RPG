# Desktop-RPG
Desktop RPG combines the idea of a desktop pet and an idle RPG game. It is a simple game that is played completely on top of your taskbar! Features include an automatically moving character, inventories and equipment, a character shop, and battles against different monsters. Free online assets are used for the [characters](https://alexdraws.itch.io/pixel-champions), [enemies](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-field-enemies-pixel-art-for-tower-defense/), and [items](https://shikashipx.itch.io/shikashis-fantasy-icons-pack).
